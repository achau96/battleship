Things I learned:

1. Test driven development. Was extremely slow and lost at the beginning. Still have a lot to learn. I still ended up creating some of the functions first before the test. It's a much different approach that will take time to get used to.
2. Kind of sorted my modules and factory functions. Still got a bit confused on where to organize things towards the end. Especially when related to the DOM.
3. A couple of algorithm techniques when trying to place the ships.

Things I can Improve On

1. Should have created a check tile function on GameBoard earlier, which just returns coordinate. Used a lot in checks and it would have been an extremely useful helper function.
2. Plan ahead. Similar to the point above and test driven development, I need to sit down and whiteboard/write out a small blueprint before I start the next process or I just end up with a lot of repitition which could easily be avoided with helper functions and placing functions in a more appropriate slot.

What I should add

1. Some messages telling player to place ship and invalid ship placement.
2. Tell player what ship they are placing.
